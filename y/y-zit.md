Born in Madagascar, Thierry Rakotomanga, alias Tizy Bone, was initially part of the R&B Trag√©die group. With his partner Silky Shai, he delivers the successful albums Unrestrained and A fleur de peau. At the end of 2005, Tizy Bone, no longer managing to manage the disputes between him and his producers, decided to embark on a solo career. For the occasion, he changed his name and renamed himself Y-zit (Tizy upside down). Under this new identity, he released his first album Ola, at the very beginning of 2006.
