By chance. In 1989, while at university, Fara (wife of Njakatiana), one of her classmates noticed her picky sense of humor. " She told me then that her brother was very interested in what I was doing, " he recalls. After a meeting and a serious discussion, the brother, who is none other than Noël Raharijaona, offers to share the stage with Njakatiana and Parson Jacques, as animator. The first attempt was a master stroke. A month later, he repeated the experience, but this time with Lil's music at the Hilton, which has now become Carlton Madagascar. It was the start of fame. Shy as he was, Francis did not intend for a career as a comedian.
