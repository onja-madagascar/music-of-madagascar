# Big Jim Dah

A real crossroads between Rap and the Malagasy discursive arts, the music of Big Jimda is not less a real marriage between two rhythms traditionally considered to be incompatible that are the ternary rhythms and those binary, but also a proof of dialogue between the Malagasy culture and other cultures in the current context of globalization. Going through the Jijy, Hosiky and antsa, which are melodious speeches sung on very spiritual instrumental, Big Jim Dah merges several other Malagasy folk music such as Hira Gasy, kalo with rap. The fruit of long years of musical research, the works of Big Jimda make us discover the richness of the music-discursive culture of Madagascar.
